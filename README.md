# PerfLens
PerfLens is a visual Python performance studio (PySide6) that turns cProfile/tracemalloc + stack sampling into interactive flame graphs, timeline traces, memory heatmaps, and call graphs—plus Diff Mode, an optimization coach, session save/load, and one-click HTML reports. Single-file app.py with a zero-input demo.
